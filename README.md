Exploratory Data Analysis 3

This repository presents an example of exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The dataset includes various academic performance metrics and demographic information. 

Descriptive Statistics
Basic information about the dataset, including data types and missing values, is displayed. Additionally, the first few rows of the dataset are printed to provide an overview.

Visualization
Histograms and boxplots are utilized to visualize the distributions of numeric variables and identify potential outliers. QQ plots assess the normality of numeric variables. Bar charts illustrate the distribution of categorical variables, and cross-tabulations explore relationships between them.

Relationships between Variables
Scatter plots are employed to visually assess relationships between numeric variables. Furthermore, correlation coefficients are calculated and visualized using a heatmap to explore correlations between variables.

Further Analysis:
Potential avenues for further analysis include group analysis by categorical variables, hypothesis testing, and modeling techniques to predict outcomes based on other variables.
